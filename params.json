His father somehow supports the family doing various odd jobs and errands, and has always tried to ensure that Promit’s studies are never disrupted. Promit made his parents and well wishers proud by first scoring 93.7% in his Madhyamik and then securing the 14th rank in the state in the 2016 H.S Examinations, with 95.6%. He joined Jadavpur University in 2016 to study Mathematics and wishes to pursue a PhD in the future. Srijan Sujan will shoulder the responsibility of this phase of his academic journey.</p>",
